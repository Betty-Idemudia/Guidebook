# Introduction
Welcome to the **UK LLC Guidebook**, the home of UK LLCâ€™s **linked data documentation** and **user guide**.

UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration (UK LLC) is the **national Trusted Research Environment (TRE)** for the **UK's longitudinal research community**. UK LLC brings together **de-identified data** from **Longitudinal Population Studies (LPS)** and systematically links these data to participants' **health, non-health administrative** (e.g. education, employment, tax and benefits) and **environmental** records in the UK LLC TRE.

To date, we have ingested **NHS England** and **geospatial datasets**. We anticipate NHS Wales and further geospatial datasets being available by the end of 2024. 

We will invite researchers to **work collaboratively** on the UK LLC Guidebook to build content and maximise use - instructions to be shared in due course. 

For information about the LPS datasets, please visit **Explore**, UK LLC's discoverability and data request app (to be launched June 2024).
