# Introduction
Welcome to **UK LLC Guidebook**, the home of UK LLCâ€™s **linked data documentation** and **user guide**.

UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration (UK LLC) is the **national Trusted Research Environment (TRE)** for the **UK's longitudinal research community**. UK LLC brings together **de-identified data** from **Longitudinal Population Studies (LPS)** and systematically links these data to participants' **health, non-health administrative** (e.g. education, employment, tax and benefits) and **environmental** records in the UK LLC TRE.

To date, we have ingested **NHS England** and **geospatial datasets**. We anticipate NHS Wales and further geospatial datasets being available by the end of 2024. 

We invite researchers to work **collaboratively** on UK LLC Guidebook to build content and maximise use - see instructions below.

For information about LPS datasets, please visit **Explore**, UK LLC's discoverability and data request app (to be launched July 2024).

**Figure 1** How to contribute to UK LLC Guidebook using Git

1. Go to the UK LLC Guidebook repo: [**https://github.com/UKLLC/Guidebook**](https://github.com/UKLLC/Guidebook) and **fork the repository**. The repo will be created in your own account. 
2. Use GitBash to **clone the repository** into a local folder of your choice (we recommend the HTTPS method) - click on the green Code button. You need to type 'git clone' into GitBash followed by the https path.   
3. Go to your forked repo and **create a branch(es)**, giving it a meaningful name. To switch to the branch you need to type 'git branch' into GitBash followed by the branch name followed by Enter and then type 'git checkout' followed by the branch name and Enter.  
4. **Make changes** to a guide(s) using e.g. MS Visual Studio Code.
5. **Prepare to submit a pull request** to UK LLC. Type 'git add .' in GitBash followed by Enter and then type 'git commit -m " " (add a short description of the change between " "). Then type 'git push'. If the push doesn't work and there is a message saying the current branch has no upstream branch, copy the suggested text (git push --set-upstream origin 'File name') and press Enter. 
6. Go to your forked repo and **submit a pull request**. Click on 'Contribute' and then submit your request. 
7. Your request will be **reviewed by UK LLC** and you will be notified by email of the outcome.
