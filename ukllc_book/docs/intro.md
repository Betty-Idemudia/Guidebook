# Introduction
Welcome to UK LLC's linked data documentation and user guide.

UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration (UK LLC) is the **national Trusted Research Environment (TRE)** for the **UK's longitudinal research community**. UK LLC brings together **de-identified data** from **Longitudinal Population Studies (LPS)** and systematically links these data to participants' **health, administrative** (e.g. education, employment, tax and benefits) and **environmental** records in the UK LLC TRE.

In this Jupyter book we document each **linked dataset** and provide a **user guide** to help researchers work efficiently and productively in the UK LLC TRE. To date, we have ingested **NHS England** and **geospatial datasets**. We anticipate NHS Wales and NHS Scotland, some administrative and further geospatial datasets being available by the end of 2024. 

We will invite researchers to **work collaboratively** on this Jupyter book to build content and maximise use. 

For information about the LPS datasets, please visit **EXPLORE**, UK LLC's discoverability and data selection portal (to be launched May 2024).
