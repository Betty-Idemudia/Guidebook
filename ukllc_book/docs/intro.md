# UK LLC Dataset Documentation

UK Longitudinal Linkage Collaboration (UK LLC) is the **national Trusted Research Environment (TRE) for the UK's longitudinal research community**. UK LLC brings together de-identified data from Longitudinal Population Studies (LPS) and systematically links these data to participants' **health, administrative** (e.g. education, employment, tax and benefits) and **environmental records** in the UK LLC TRE.

In this Jupyter book we will provide overview and detailed information about each dataset to help researchers conduct analyses in the UK LLC TRE. To date, we have ingested NHS England datasets and geospatial datasets and so these will be our initial focus. We anticipate NHS Wales datasets and some administrative datasets being available by the end of 2024. We will invite researchers to work collaboratively on the Jupyter book to maximise its use.
