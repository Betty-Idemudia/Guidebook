A stay in hospital from admission to discharge is called a ‘spell’ and can be made up of one or more episodes of care. HES APC looks at completed episodes, called Finished Admission Episodes (FAEs), which is the first episode in a spell of care, and Finished Consultant Episodes (FCEs), which is a continuous period of care under one consultant.\n",

This is submitted to NHS Digital for processing and is returned to healthcare providers as the Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data set and includes information relating to payment for activity undertaken. It allows hospitals to be paid for the care they deliver. \n",
       "\n",
       "This same data can also be processed and used for non-clinical purposes, such as research and planning health services. Because these uses are not to do with direct patient care, they are called 'secondary uses'. This is the HES data set.\n",

A **spell** is a continuous period of care within a single hospital from admission to discharge or death.

The first (or only) FCE can also be called a **Finished Admission Episode (FAE)** and the final (or only) FCE can also be called a **Discharge Episode**.
