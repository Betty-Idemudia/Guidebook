# Mental health datasets
>Last modified: 26 Jun 2024
## Introduction  
NHS England flows extracts of two **mental health datasets** into the UK LLC TRE - see Table 1. When we refer to the **Mental Health Services Data Set (MHSDS)** we include its **two precursors**, the Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Data Set (MHLDDS) and the Mental Health Minimum Data Set (MHMDS), which were retired in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The MHSDS and Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) dataset are increasingly using clinical terminology to capture clinical information, primarily through **SNOMED-CT** - see the [**Coded variables guide**](../Coding/coding_intro.md) for further details.

The mental health datasets are **complex** and **change in scope** on a typically annual basis. UK LLC is collaborating with experts to improve documentation of these datasets and updates will be released in due course.

## Coverage of mental health datasets
Table 1 summarises the **temporal coverage** of the two mental health datasets. Both datasets primarily only cover **England** - see below.
