# Mental health datasets
## Introduction  
NHS England flows extracts of two key **mental health datasets** into the UK LLC TRE - see Table 1. When we refer to the **Mental Health Services Data Set (MHSDS)** we include its **two precursors**, the Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Data Set (MHLDDS) and the Mental Health Minimum Data Set (MHMDS), which were retired in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

The mental health datasets are **complex** and **change in scope** on a typically annual basis. UK LLC is collaborating with experts to improve documentation of these datasets and the individual dataset guides will be released in due course.

## Coverage of mental health datasets
Table 1 summarises the **temporal coverage** of the two mental health datasets. Both datasets primarily only cover **England** - see below.

## MHSDS dataset
The MHSDS collects data about **children, young people** and **adults** who are in contact with **in patient** and **community** services for mental health and wellbeing, learning disability, autism or other neurodevelopmental condition. The MHSDS does not collect data about adult IAPT services. 

Included in the MHSDS are patients treated at services located in England and those treated at services located outside England if they are commissioned by an English Integrated Care Board or NHS England specialised commissioner. 

Submission of data is **mandatory** for care received in England if the person is at least partially funded by the NHS. It is **optional** for NHS-funded patients treated outside England and those wholly funded by non-NHS means. More than 300 organisations submit data each month, more than 90% of which are NHS Trusts. However, there is an increasing number of other types of organisations that are NHS-funded and therefore submit data, including voluntary care services, independent sector organisations, and councils and charities. 

The dataset provides information about the type of care received, the length of care episodes, as well as information about contact with mental health and social care professionals, and measures of health and social functioning. 

MHSDS is **referral based** which allows tracking between services and settings. The dataset includes all data relevant to the reporting period, not just finished episodes, and so researchers need to be careful of **over-counting**. 


## IAPT dataset
The IAPT dataset will shortly be renamed the **NHS Talking Therapies for Anxiety and Depression dataset**. 

The dataset collects data about **adults in England** who receive NHS-funded treatment for depression and anxiety disorders under the **NHS Talking Therapies programme**. Conditions treated include agoraphobia, body dysmorphic disorder, depression, generalised anxiety disorder, health anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, post traumatic stress disorder and a wide range of specific phobias. 

Submission of data is **mandatory** for all NHS funded IAPT service providers, including care delivered by independent sector healthcare providers.

As for the MSDS, IAPT is **referral based** which allows tracking between services and settings. The dataset includes all data relevant to the reporting period, not just finished episodes, and so researchers need to be careful of **over-counting**. 


## Clinical classifications in mental health datasets
The MHSDS and IAPT are increasingly using clinical terminology to capture clinical information, primarily through **SNOMED-CT** - see the [**Coded variables guide**](../NHS_England/Coding/coding_intro.md) for further details.

## Structure of mental health datasets
The structure of the **MHSDS is particularly complex**. It comprises around 60 separate datasets and approximately 1,000 variables. However, the modular nature of MHSDS means that not all datasets are submitted by all organisations - it depends on the services each organisation provides. **IAPT** comprises around 20 separate datasets. 

Current and past data models, user guidance and technical output specifications are available here for [**MHSDS**](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-sets/mental-health-services-data-set/tools-and-guidance) and here for [**IAPT**.](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-sets/improving-access-to-psychological-therapies-data-set/implementing-iapt-tools-and-guidance)



## Data quality of mental health datasets
Overall, data quality in the **MHSDS** is sufficient for analysing data in relation to activity. However, other aspects of the MHSDS are poor, particularly where submission of data items is not mandated. Data can be resubmitted up until the end of the financial year to fix known data quality issues. See the [**MHSDS data quality dashboard**](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/mental-health-data-hub/data-quality/mental-health-services-dataset---data-quality-dashboard) and the [**IAPT data quality notes**](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-sets/improving-access-to-psychological-therapies-data-set/improving-access-to-psychological-therapies-data-set-reports) for further information.
