# Core Data
## Overview
The UK LLC make available a number of standard ‘core’ files with each project. These files contain information enabling researchers to understand their sample and define the denominator for their project. Currently the following datasets are available:

* CORE denominator file1
* CORE NHSD Presence 
* CORE NHSD Derived indicator
* CORE NHSD LSOA11
* CORE LSOA11 geo indicators

## Permissions and data refreshes
Core datasets containing data derived from NHS E datasets are filtered on the studies selected in the NHS E linked data section of the UK LLC data request form. In these cases participants are also filtered using the NHS E permissions. Core datasets are updated each quarter but researchers view of these data are 'locked' to permissions at time of first data provision. The permissions themselves can be found in the CORE denominator file1 e.g. CORE_denominator_file1_v0001_20220412.
