# TRE user guide
>Last modified: 05 Jul 2024


Welcome to the **UK LLC TRE user guide**. Here, we provide guidance that should cover all aspects of **working on your project in the TRE**, from first login, working with your approved data, including the available software packages, working with Git, submitting a file out, requesting an amendment, finishing your project and publishing your research. 

To understand more about the **linked datasets** available to you, please click on the **data source headings**, e.g. NHS England. For more information about the **LPS datasets**, please visit **EXPLORE**, UK LLC's discoverability and data selection portal (to be launched May 2024).

Also available in the TRE user guide is a list of **FAQs** that we've compiled from researcher enquiries and a summary of the **rules** you have agreed to abide by when working in the UK LLC TRE. 

If there are any aspects you feel could be **better explained** or would benefit from **more detail**, please email the UK LLC Data Team at [**support@ukllc.ac.uk**](mailto:support@ukllc.ac.uk). We are committed to making your time in the UK LLC TRE as efficient and productive as possible and very much **welcome feedback from researchers**.
